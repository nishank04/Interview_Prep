//Given a picture, how would you hide/show a child picture on hovering on this parent?

#parent:hover img {
visibility:hidden
}

.parentClass:hover .child { display: none/float}

//Clicking a picture to go on a different link

Technique 1: Use image tag inside the anchor tag.

Example:

<a href=”your-link”>

<img src=”your-path” >

</a>

Technique 2: use JavaScript onclick event.

Example:

<img src=”your-path” onclick="goToThisLink(‘your-link')">

<script>

function "goToThisLink(url) {

window.location.href = url;

}

</script>

How would you ensure the child is positioned in the top right of the parent picture?
.parent {
    position: relative;
    .child { position: absolute; top: 0; right0; }
    }


    Using HTML and CSS, show how you would create an image that would display another image (aligned to the bottom, right) when the user hovers over the image.

    CSS question is fairly easy. Given two img elements with the classes "one" and "two", you can give them the styles:
    .two{
    display:none;
    }
    .one:hover + .two{
    display: block;
    }
